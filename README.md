# PES Final Project - ZX Gesture Sensor
This Repository contains the files for the Final Project of the course Principles of Embedded Software (PES) at University of Colorado Boulder.

Technologies Used:
1. I2C: Used for interfacing with the SEN-13162 ZX sensor
2. State Machines: Employed to interpret gesture inputs and manage control states
3. Command Processing: Each recognized gesture will translate to a command for specific output control. 
4. GPIO Lines: Used to control LEDs or other outputs in response to gestures. 
5. UART: UART will be used for debugging and logging gesture data to a serial monitor.
